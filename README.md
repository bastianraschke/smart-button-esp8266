# Smart Wi-Fi button with ESP8266

This project is the firmware for a Wi-Fi connected button that can send HTTPS requests, for example to control your OpenHAB smarthome setup. After the connection the ESP8266 goes back to deep sleep to allow to run the button on batteries for a long time.

The project is [fully documentated](https://sicherheitskritisch.de/2017/03/build-your-own-smart-wi-fi-button-for-9-euros-en/) on my blog [Sicherheitskritisch](https://sicherheitskritisch.de).
